# VBA-challenge
For this project, I created a VBA (Visual Basic) script to analyze some stock market data. The data is inside a Microsoft Excel workbook and includes stock data from 2014-16. Each year is a different tab/sheet inside the workbook.

I could not upload the stocks file due to its size, so I have uploaded the alphabetical stock sheet that I tested it on. There are several modules different modules containing several variations of the script. I also uploaded several images and raw script data.


Please note:
I have gotten behind over the past week due to an unexpexted family passing and a subsequent virus I had the following five days.  I have been able to engineer some of the information for the homework, but I will resubmit something when I get caught up and have a greater understanding of the material.

Thanks,
Radford Aldridge
